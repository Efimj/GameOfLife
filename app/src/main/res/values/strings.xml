    <string name="the_game_of_life">The Game of Life</string>
    <string name="GameOfLife_large_description">The **Game of Life**, also known simply as "Life," is a cellular
        automaton developed in 1970. It is a zero-player game, indicating that its evolution is solely determined by its
        initial state and does not necessitate additional actions. Players engage with the Game of Life by creating an
        initial configuration and observing its development. Notably, it is Turing complete, allowing it to model a
        universal constructor or any other Turing machine.
        \n\n## Universe Description
        \n\nThe universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid consisting of square cells.
        Each cell can exist in one of two states: live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Interaction
        takes place between each cell and its eight neighbors, encompassing cells that are horizontally, vertically, or
        diagonally adjacent.
        \n\n## Evolution Rules
        \n\nAt each step in time, the following transitions occur:
        \n\n- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
        \n\n- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
        \n\n- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
        \n\n- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
