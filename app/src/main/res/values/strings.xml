    <string name="GameOfLife_large_description">The Game of Life, also known simply as "Life", is a cellular automaton
        developed in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state and
        does not require additional actions. A person interacts with the Game of Life, creating an initial configuration
        and watching how it develops. It is Turing complete and can model a universal constructor or any other Turing
        machine
