## Description

The Game of Life, also known simply as "Life", is a cellular automaton
developed in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state and
does not require additional actions. A person interacts with the Game of Life, creating an initial configuration
and watching how it develops. It is Turing complete and can model a universal constructor or any other Turing
machine.
> [!IMPORTANT]\
> ### Rules
>- In an empty (dead) cell, if there are exactly three living neighbors, life is born
>- If a living cell has two or three living neighbors, it continues to live; otherwise, the cell dies (due to "
   loneliness" or "overcrowding")
